•	Abstract
         This study offers a CMOS circuit for a 2-bit magnitude comparator. The most fundamental arithmetic operation is comparison, which determines whether one number is greater   than, equal to, or less than another. The most basic component that conducts comparison operations is the comparator. In addition, we will use the Synopsys tool to simulate a 2-bit magnitude comparator that is implemented in 28nm technology.
•	Introduction
        In digital system, comparison of two numbers is an arithmetic operation that determines if one number is greater than, equal to, or less than the other number [1]. A comparator is a logic circuit used to compare the magnitude of two binary numbers. Depending on the design, it may either simply provide an output that is active (goes HIGH) when the two numbers are equal, or additionally provide outputs that signify which of the numbers is greater when equality does not hold
