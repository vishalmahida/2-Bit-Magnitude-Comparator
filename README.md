  1. Abstract
     > This study offers a CMOS circuit for a 2-bit magnitude comparator.The most fundamental arithmetic operation is comparison, which determines whether one number is greater   than, equal to, or less than another. The most basic component that conducts comparison operations is the comparator. In addition, we will use the Synopsys tool to simulate a 2-bit magnitude comparator that is implemented in 28nm technology.
